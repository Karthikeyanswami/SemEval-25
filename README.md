# SemEval-25
Task 9 : Food Hazard and Product Detection Category Identification and Vector Prediction

# Abstract

Food safety is a critical global concern, and timely detection of food-related hazards is essential for public health and economic stability. The automated detection of food hazards from textual data can enhance food safety monitoring by enabling early identification of potential risks.

In the Food Hazard Detection task, we address two key challenges:

(ST1): Food hazard-category and product-category classification

(ST2): Food hazard and product vector detection.

For ST1, we employ BertForSequenceClassification, leveraging its powerful contextual understanding for accurate food hazard classification.

For ST2, we utilize a Random Forest Classifier, which effectively captures patterns in the extracted features for food hazard and product vector detection.

This paper presents the results of the TechSSN3 team at the SemEval-2025 Food Hazard Detection Task, where we achieved a ranking of 21st in Task 1 and 19th in Task 2.
