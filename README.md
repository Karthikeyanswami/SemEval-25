# SemEval-25
Task 9 : Food Hazard and Product Detection Category Identification and Vector Prediction

#Abstract
 Food safety is a critical global concern, and
 timely detection of food-related hazards is es
sential for public health and economic stabil
ity.The automated detection of food hazards
 from textual data can enhance food safety mon
itoring by enabling early identification of poten
tial risks. In the Food Hazard Detection task,
 we address two key challenges: (ST1) food
 hazard-category and product-category classifi
cation and (ST2) food hazard and product vec
tor detection. For ST1, we employ BertForSe
quenceClassification, leveraging its powerful
 contextual understanding for accurate food haz
ard classification. For ST2, we utilize a Ran
dom Forest Classifier, which effectively cap
tures patterns in the extracted features for food
 hazard and product vector detection. This pa
per presents the results of the TechSSN3 team
 at the SemEval-2025 Food Hazard Detection
 Task, where we achieved a ranking of 21st in
 Task 1 and 19th in Task 2.
